```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%")

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_color_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

## Problem 1

#### Read in Data

```{r}
homicide = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

This dataset contains `r ncol(homicide)` variables with `r nrow(homicide)` observations.  Each homicide is distinguished by an unique id, contains basic demographic information about the victim, the location and reported date of the murder, and whether an arrest was made. 

#### Create `city_state` var

```{r}
homicide %>% 
  unite(city_state, c("city", "state"), sep = ", ") %>% 
  filter(disposition != "Closed by arrest") %>% 
  group_by(city_state, disposition) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())
```

#### `prop.test` proportions
